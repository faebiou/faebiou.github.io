Hi. My name is Fabio Pop and I am a freelance type designer currently working on some fonts like the one you are reading now. I play drums in [a band](https://instagram.com/zakuszka.live), enjoy [terrible puns](https://instagram.com/sacc.kabe) in Hungarian, and I live in The Hague.

Besides type, I am also available as a graphic design consultant, so reach out if you need a hand with anything related to typography, branding, creative coding, or motion graphics â€“ or just want to vent for a bit or something.

Find me on instagram or mastodon or say hi via hi@faebiou.com
