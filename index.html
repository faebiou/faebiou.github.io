    <h2 id="hi">Hi.</h2>

        <p>My name is Fabio Pop and I like letters, colors, motion, and code.</p>

        <p>I am available for <span class="italic">client work</span>, but I also do <span class="italic">freelance consultancy</span> to help if you’re feeling stuck on, perplexed by, or enraged over a project.</p>

        <p>Look… I’m not not here to pretend that I have all the answers, easy solutions, and quick fixes. Or anything, really.</p>

        <p>The only thing I have to offer is a <span class="italic">fresh set of eyes</span> that might see things that you might have missed.</p>

        <p>But make no mistake: that's not insight or experience. It's <span class="italic">distance.</span> And that might sometimes be difficult to get alone.</p>

        <p>So don’t hesitate to get in touch if you’re stuck with anything related to typography, type design, lettering, branding, motion graphics, creative coding, or just want to vent about a project or something.</p>

        <p id="lastLine">Find me <a href="mailto:hi@faebiou.com">here</a>, on <a href="http://instagram.com/faebiou" target="_blank">instagram</a>, or on <a href="http://typo.social/@faebiou" target="_blank">mastodon</a></p>

        <p id="colofon">Made with <span id="heart">♥</span> & set in <a href="http://boldmonday.com">Plex</a> of course.</p>
